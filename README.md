#Sparkler
#####C++ Raytracer.

######Realized features:
- [x] Anti-Aliasing
- [x] Blin-Phong shading model
- [x] Reflections
- [x] Refractions and transparency (Snells law)
- [x] Basic primitives and transformations
- [x] Simple triangle meshes
- [x] Texture mapping
- [x] Enviroment mapping
- [x] Point, Directional light
- [x] Monte Carlo area light (soft shadows)
- [x] Diffuse reflections

######Futher work:
- [ ] More realistic diffuse reflections (Hemisphere samling)
- [ ] More realistic transparency (Fresnel equation)
- [ ] Depth of field
- [ ] Mothion blur
